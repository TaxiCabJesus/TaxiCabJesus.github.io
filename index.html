<p>When I was a taxi driver, I participated in the Taxi Wars. </p>

<p>My first taxi lease was in March 2012. I needed something to do, to support myself, so I signed up to be a driver with the Phoenix Metropolitan biggest cab company, because <em>I remembered</em> who I called that time that <em>I</em> had to take a taxi, 3 years before. The money was never great, but enough to get by. </p>

<p>After my eighth lease, I started an online diary to better remember all of the interesting people I was meeting. I had no idea what was to come. At first the entries just cataloged most of the people I'd met on that day's lease, but gradually patterns and themes for my efforts as a taxi driver appeared, and the diaries took on a different form. I'd ask questions of people, and try to figure out if they had something to teach me.</p>

<p>At first the taxi wars was a fair game between equals. The state government had a "free market" approach to transportation regulation. </p>

<p>Then the dark times arrived, and the state's "free market" approach to regulation rapidly shifted to "anything goes". </p>

<p>While I do miss my days in the cab, something came up that I thought was more important. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features. </p>
